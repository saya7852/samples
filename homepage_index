            <br>
            <h4><a href="current.html">Next Up:</a></h4><p>Those nasty potholes have been patched up for the time being.
            What's coming next as our BIG project is the paving of the lane, and this is an opportunity to reinstall
            the lighting to maintain safety on the lane.&ensp; <a href="current.html">Read more...</a></p>
